# This app was built during a live stream

I wanted to build a small application with people online so we could all learn together. This is my final version of said project.

- [**Live Demo**](https://superb-iss-tracker-9000.netlify.app/)

## To get the project running

In the project directory, you need to run these TWO commands in the following order:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies required to start the project. We are going to add more, but we need these to launch the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
